Golumbic, Lipshteyn and Stern defined in 2009 the class of EPG graphs, an intersection graph class  based on edge intersection of paths on a grid. An EPG graph $G$ is a graph that admits a representation where its vertices correspond to paths in a grid $Q$, such that two vertices of $G$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding paths in $Q$ have a common edge. If the paths in the representation have at most $k$ changes of direction  (bends), we say that this is a  $B_k$-EPG representation. A collection $C$ of sets satisfies the Helly property when every sub-collection of $C$ that is pairwise intersecting has at least a common element. In this paper we show that the problem of  recognizing $B_k$-EPG-Helly graphs  
% $G=(V,E)$ whose edge-intersections of paths in a grid satisfy the Helly property, so-called $B_k$-EPG-Helly graphs, 
 is in $\mathcal{NP}$, for every $k$ bounded by a polynomial function of $|V(G)|$. In addition, we show that recognizing $B_1$-EPG-Helly graphs is $NP$-complete, and it remains $NP$-complete even when restricted to 2-apex and 3-degenerate graphs.



Keywords: Edge-intersection of paths on a grid, Helly property, Intersection graphs, $NP$-completeness, Single bend paths.
