The Graph Theory is a branch of the math that is used by the Computer Science to describe and model several real and theoretical problems.  This doctoral thesis is dedicated to solving some problems of Graph Theory. In particular, in this chapter you will find a brief description of the related problems, the motivation of the study and a resume on the organization of the text.

\section{Motivation, Goals and Thesis Structure}


\emph{Graph Theory} is based on relations of points that we called vertices interconnected (by elements denoted as edges) in a network. In this context we define a graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V(G)$ denote the vertex set of $G$ and $E(G)$ its edge set. The graph is the object that we use to model the relationship among  elements of a set.

An \emph{intersection graph} is a graph that represents the pattern of intersections of a family of sets. In this doctoral thesis, we are interested in the study of intersection graphs. Issues related to intersection graphs have been attracting the attention of researchers since the 1960, e.g. \cite{erdos1966representation}, and to the present day, see~\cite{petito2002grafos,jose2018}.

 First, we know that every graph is an intersection graph, i.e. any graph can be represented by some intersection model, \cite{szpilrajn1945translation, erdos1966representation}. \citet{scheinerman1985characterizing} presents a research that is exclusively dedicated to characterization of classes of intersection graphs, also providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of intersection representations for some specific graph class.


Many important graph families can be described as intersection graphs, we can cite among them interval, circular-arc, permutation, trapezoid, chordal,
disk, circle graphs are more important or at leas the most studied in the literature in general. 

For us, in this study some among these classes are interesting. The class of Interval graphs, i.e. the intersection graph of set of segments on a line, and the class of Chordal graphs, that are graphs where each cycle $C_n, n\geq 3$ has a chord. Interval graphs have been extensively studied by~\cite{lekkeikerker1962representation}. About Chordal graphs, \citet{gavril1974intersection} show that this class corresponds exactly to the intersection graph of subtrees on a tree. In this thesis, we will study intersection graphs of paths on a grid and on trees.

\citet{golumbic2009} defined the edge intersection graphs of paths on a grid (EPG graphs). Similarly, \cite{asinowski2011string, asinowski2012} defined the vertex intersection graphs of paths on a grid (VPG graphs).  Both intersection models have some practical importance, since they can be used to generalize naturally the context of
circuit layout problems and layout optimization~\cite{sinden1966topology} where a layout is modeled
as paths (wires) on a grid. Thus, they are problems that arise directly from this modeling: reducing the number of times that each path can to bend in order to minimize the cost or difficulty of production~\cite{bandy1990,molitor1991}; or  other times layouts may consist of several layers where the paths on each layer are not allowed to intersect, this can be understood as a colouring problem. These are the main applications that instigate research on the EPG and VPG representations of some graph families. Other applications and details on circuit layout problems can be found in~\cite{bandy1990, molitor1991, sinden1966topology}.

Some particular questions related to intersection graphs aroused our research interest. Among these, we can quote: What is the complexity of recognizing a class of path intersection graphs on a grid if we restrict the number of bends in each path individually and considering the fact of each set of intersections have a common element? Will it be possible to solve the problem of calculating some parameter in the class of paths intersection graphs on a grid  even when the entire paths bend $k$ times? Is there any relationship among the classes of intersection graphs when we change the tree host to a grid host? The answers to these and other questions are diluted in the next chapters of this thesis.


The text of this thesis is distributed over the next 5 chapters as follows.


Chapter~\ref{Notions} contains the definitions and concepts needed to fully understand this work.  In addition, we provide a short overview of the problems studied and a brief literature review on the main subjects covered in the text.

Chapter~\ref{cap:capiii} will be dedicated to the study of the Helly property and EPG graphs. In particular, the chapter presents an analysis of some basic EPG representations, a comparison of $L$-shaped paths and $B_1$-EPG graph classes, as well as a proof of the $NP$-completeness of the Helly-$B_1$ EPG  graph recognition problem~\cite{dmtcs:6506}.

In Chapter~\ref{cap:iv}, the parameters Helly number and strong Helly number will be studied for  $ B_k$-EPG and $ B_k$-VPG graphs. We used the strategy of determining tight lower and upper bounds to show the value of the Helly and strong Helly number parameters in each class and for each value of $k$.

\end{enumerate}



The Chapter~\ref{cap:v} presents relationship among Chordal $B_1$-EPG, VPT and EPT graphs. The reader will find a set of induced subgraphs that appear in any graph that does not belong to Helly-$B_1$ EPG but belongs to $B_1$-EPG and non-trivial graph classes that are included by Helly-$B_1$ EPG, namely Bipartite, Blocks, Cactus and Line of Bipartite. The main result of this chapter is the prove that every Chordal $B_1$-EPG graph is simultaneously in the VPT and EPT classes.  The writing of this chapter and corresponding research was done while the author of this doctoral thesis (Tanilson) was a doctoral research (sandwich doctoral by 1 year) fellow at National University of La Plata - UNLP, Math Department.

The results obtained in this thesis can be found at the final of each
chapter in its last section, as well as all set of the complete proofs. In the
text we have chosen to hide some proofs for simplicity, thus the reader will find in each chapter only  proofs that we think to be more relevant. %  in structure of this thesis. %but the complete proofs are in each paper at the end corresponding chapter. 

Next, we present the basic concepts. Good reading.
